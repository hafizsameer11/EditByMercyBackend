# ✅ Chat Service Category Fix - One Active Chat Per Service

## 🎯 Problem

Users could create multiple chats for the same service category, leading to:
- ❌ Multiple pending orders for the same service
- ❌ Confusion about which chat to use
- ❌ Worked for "Body Retouching" but not for other services

**User Requirement:**
- Only ONE active chat per service category
- New chat requests should redirect to existing pending chat
- New chat only allowed when agent marks current order as "closed/completed"

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Updated Logic in `ChatController::assignAgent()`**

The new logic follows a 3-step approach:

### **STEP 1: Check for Existing Pending Orders** ✅

```php
// Check if user already has a pending/active order for THIS service type
$existingPendingOrder = Order::where('user_id', $authUserId)
    ->where('service_type', $serviceType)
    ->whereIn('status', ['pending', 'processing']) // Not closed yet
    ->whereHas('chat') // Make sure chat still exists
    ->first();

if ($existingPendingOrder && $existingPendingOrder->chat) {
    // REDIRECT to existing chat
    return ResponseHelper::success(
        new AssignedAgentViewModel($existingPendingOrder->chat),
        'You already have an active order for this service. Please complete or close the current order before starting a new one.',
        200
    );
}
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Searches for ANY pending/processing order for the user in the requested service category
- ✅ Works across ALL chats (not just with one specific agent)
- ✅ Redirects user to existing chat if found
- ✅ Prevents duplicate orders

---

### **STEP 2: Check for Completed Orders** ✅

```php
// Check if user has a completed order for this service type
$completedOrder = Order::where('user_id', $authUserId)
    ->where('service_type', $serviceType)
    ->where('status', 'success')
    ->latest()
    ->first();

if ($completedOrder && $completedOrder->chat) {
    // CREATE NEW ORDER in the same chat
    $newOrderDTO = new OrderDTO(
        user_id: $authUserId,
        agent_id: $completedOrder->agent_id,
        service_type: $serviceType,
        chat_id: $completedOrder->chat_id
    );
    $this->orderService->createOrder($newOrderDTO);
    
    return ResponseHelper::success($data, 'New order created in your existing chat for this service.', 201);
}
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ If user completed an order for this service before, reuse that chat
- ✅ Creates new order in the existing chat
- ✅ Maintains chat history with same agent
- ✅ User doesn't need to introduce themselves again

---

### **STEP 3: Create New Chat (First Time)** ✅

```php
// No existing orders for this service type - create new chat
$agent = $this->userService->getSupportAgent();

$chatDto = new ChatDTO(
    type: 'user-agent',
    user_id: $authUserId,
    user_2_id: $agent->id ?? null,
    agent_id: $agent->id ?? null
);
$chat = $this->chatService->createChat($chatDto);

$orderDto = new OrderDTO(
    user_id: $authUserId,
    agent_id: $agent->id ?? null,
    service_type: $serviceType,
    chat_id: $chat->id ?? null
);
$this->orderService->createOrder($orderDto);
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Only runs if user has NO history with this service
- ✅ Assigns fresh agent
- ✅ Creates brand new chat
- ✅ Creates first order

## 🔄 Flow Diagram

```
User requests service X
        ↓
Does user have PENDING order for service X?
        ↓
    YES → Redirect to existing chat ✅
    NO  → Continue
        ↓
Does user have COMPLETED order for service X?
        ↓
    YES → Create new order in same chat ✅
    NO  → Continue
        ↓
First time for this service
        ↓
Create new chat + new order ✅
```

## 📊 Service Categories

The fix works for **ALL 4 service categories:**

1. ✅ **Photo Editing**
2. ✅ **Photo Manipulation**
3. ✅ **Body Retouching**
4. ✅ **Body Reshaping**

## 🎯 User Experience

### **Scenario 1: User tries to start duplicate chat**

**Before Fix:**
```
User → Request "Body Retouching"
     → New chat created (even though pending order exists)
     → Result: 2 chats for same service ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```
User → Request "Body Retouching"
     → System finds pending order
     → Redirects to existing chat ✅
     → Message: "You already have an active order for this service"
```

---

### **Scenario 2: User wants new order after completion**

**Before Fix:**
```
User → Previous order completed
     → Request same service again
     → May create new chat or not work ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```
User → Previous order marked "success"
     → Request same service again
     → New order created in SAME chat ✅
     → Keeps chat history and relationship with agent
```

---

### **Scenario 3: First time using a service**

**Before & After (Same):**
```
User → Request new service (first time)
     → New chat created ✅
     → New order created ✅
```

## 🔍 Key Differences from Old Logic

### **Old Logic (❌ Had Issues):**
```php
// Only checked chat between user and ONE specific agent
$chat = $this->chatService->findChatBetweenUsers($authUserId, $agent->id);

// Only checked pending orders IN THAT SPECIFIC CHAT
$pendingOrder = $chat->order()
    ->where('service_type', $serviceType)
    ->where('status', 'pending')
    ->first();
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Only looked at chats with ONE agent
- ❌ If user had pending order with different agent, it would create duplicate
- ❌ Didn't check across ALL user's chats
- ❌ Only worked by coincidence for some services

---

### **New Logic (✅ Fixed):**
```php
// Check ALL orders for this user in this service category
$existingPendingOrder = Order::where('user_id', $authUserId)
    ->where('service_type', $serviceType)
    ->whereIn('status', ['pending', 'processing'])
    ->whereHas('chat') // Make sure chat exists
    ->first();
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Checks across ALL chats
- ✅ Checks across ALL agents
- ✅ Prevents duplicates for ANY service category
- ✅ Works consistently for all 4 services

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Test 1: Duplicate Prevention**
```bash
# Step 1: Create initial chat
POST /api/assign-agent
{
  "service_type": "Photo Editing"
}
# Response: 201 - New chat created

# Step 2: Try to create another chat for same service
POST /api/assign-agent
{
  "service_type": "Photo Editing"
}
# Response: 200 - Redirected to existing chat
# Message: "You already have an active order for this service..."
```

**Expected:** ✅ No duplicate chat created

---

### **Test 2: Different Service Categories**
```bash
# User can have multiple chats for DIFFERENT services
POST /api/assign-agent
{
  "service_type": "Photo Editing"
}
# Response: 201 - Chat 1 created

POST /api/assign-agent
{
  "service_type": "Body Retouching"
}
# Response: 201 - Chat 2 created (different service)
```

**Expected:** ✅ Two separate chats allowed (different services)

---

### **Test 3: After Order Completion**
```bash
# Step 1: Complete existing order
PATCH /api/orders/123/status
{
  "status": "success"
}

# Step 2: Request same service again
POST /api/assign-agent
{
  "service_type": "Photo Editing"
}
# Response: 201 - New order in existing chat
```

**Expected:** ✅ New order created in same chat

---

### **Test 4: All 4 Service Categories**
```bash
# Test each service type
Services = ["Photo Editing", "Photo Manipulation", "Body Retouching", "Body Reshaping"]

For each service:
  POST /api/assign-agent { "service_type": service }
  # Should create 4 separate chats (one per service)
  
  POST /api/assign-agent { "service_type": service }
  # Should redirect to existing chat (no duplicate)
```

**Expected:** ✅ 4 chats total, no duplicates within same service

---

## 📝 Order Status Flow

### **Active/Pending Statuses** (Block new chat):
- `pending` - Order created, waiting for agent
- `processing` - Agent working on order

### **Closed/Completed Statuses** (Allow new chat):
- `success` - Order completed successfully
- `failed` - Order failed/cancelled
- `closed` - Order marked as closed by agent

---

## 🎨 Frontend Impact

### **Success Response (Existing Chat)**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "You already have an active order for this service. Please complete or close the current order before starting a new one.",
  "data": {
    "chat": {
      "id": 123,
      "user_id": 456,
      "agent_id": 789,
      // ... existing chat data
    }
  }
}
```

**Frontend should:**
1. ✅ Open the existing chat
2. ✅ Show message to user
3. ✅ Don't allow creating new chat

---

### **Success Response (New Order in Existing Chat)**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "New order created in your existing chat for this service.",
  "data": {
    "chat": {
      "id": 123,
      // ... chat data with NEW order
    }
  }
}
```

**Frontend should:**
1. ✅ Open the existing chat
2. ✅ Show new order in chat
3. ✅ Maintain chat history

---

### **Success Response (New Chat)**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "New chat and order created successfully.",
  "data": {
    "chat": {
      "id": 789,
      // ... new chat data
    }
  }
}
```

**Frontend should:**
1. ✅ Open the new chat
2. ✅ Start fresh conversation

---

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Prevents Confusion** ✅
   - Users can't accidentally create multiple chats for same service
   - Clear which chat to use for which service

2. **Better Organization** ✅
   - One chat per service category
   - Easy to track order status

3. **Maintains Relationships** ✅
   - User works with same agent for repeat orders
   - Chat history preserved

4. **Works Universally** ✅
   - All 4 service categories work the same way
   - Consistent behavior across the app

5. **Agent Efficiency** ✅
   - Agents don't need to check multiple chats for same service
   - All orders for a service in one place

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Change Active Statuses**

To modify which statuses are considered "active" (blocking new chats):

```php
// In ChatController.php, line 199
->whereIn('status', ['pending', 'processing', 'your_custom_status'])
```

### **Change Completed Statuses**

To modify which statuses are considered "completed" (allowing new orders):

```php
// In ChatController.php, line 217
->where('status', 'success') // or 'completed', 'closed', etc.
```

---

## 📊 Database Queries

### **Check for Pending Orders**
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE user_id = ? 
  AND service_type = ? 
  AND status IN ('pending', 'processing')
  AND chat_id IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1;
```

### **Check for Completed Orders**
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE user_id = ? 
  AND service_type = ? 
  AND status = 'success'
  AND chat_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---
